# Conclusion

## Observations

Based on the data that has been displayed in this app, we can observe that:

* A couple of the most common reasons why couples choose to sleep separately would be that one person is sick, or one person snores.
* There are more participants that disagreed that sleeping separately helps couples stay together rather than agreed.
* When asked if participants slept better when sleeping separately, results were distributed fairly evenly amongst all choices within the range of "Strongly agree" and "Strongly disagree".
* A significant amount of participants "Strongly disagree" that sleeping separately does _not_ improve their sex life.
* The percentage of couples that sleep separately every night appears to increase as the age of the couple increases.
* The percentage of couples that sleep separately every night appears to be higher for couples that have been together for more than 20 years.
